edit - simple text editor
=========================
edit is a suckless, simple yet powerful terminal-based text editor.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (edit is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install edit (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running edit
------------
Simply invoke the 'edit' command with a file path:

    edit filename


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of edit is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
