## TODO

manipulating hex values: when are casts needed ?


### Review engine

* rewrite syntax in cheatsheet.md (| can't follow REP...)
* review the process, ensure compliance with syntax
* explain the process and the use of variables

* good order of variables ?
* is each step commented accordingly ?
* is the code written well-enough ? <= 80 chars ?
* should that be replaced by a macro ?
* is this strange behaviour covered in the tutorial and philosophy ?

* test everything (classes, last element of group)


### Publication

* review engine
* finalise readme.md, tutor.def.md, philosophy.md
* extensive testing trough `make tutor`
* finalise config.def.h, including colorscheme
* add languages and finalise languages.md
* final check for each file
* script, do and upload the screencast, modify *.md accordingly
* better colors.html
* suppress notes.md, clean makefile
* tarball and upload it all
* publish on github
