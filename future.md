## Executing a shell command

The following could be nice:

* Being prompted a dialog for a custom command to be run
* Being able to choose if command is executed in the shell or if it happens in
  the background, if it is in the shell, being able to choose if it waits for
  confirmation before the editor comes back
* Being able to pipe selections to the command
* Having language-specific commands

However I'm still looking for a suckless way to integrate these features.


## Tab completion

* search engine on `select_line_range` selections ?
* with `find_next_word` ?
* `last_was_completion = 0` by default, else length of partial word to be
  completed for looping over ?
